//Q-12  Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name,
// print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized
//with the person’s name.


const My_friens_name = ["Shazaib", "Aqib", "Falk"];

const greetings  = "Good Morning ! Have a Good day";
console.log(My_friens_name[0]+" "+greetings);
console.log(My_friens_name[1]+" "+greetings);
console.log(My_friens_name[2]+" "+greetings);
